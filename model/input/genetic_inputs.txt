# Parameters controlling genetic aspects of the model
# loci_of_interest lists the loci which are being included in the simulation (do not leave space after comma)
# heterozygous_protection lists the relative protection of heterozygous genotypes if resistance loci are included
# if loci governs resistance, name must match a name on outbreak_response.txt
# 			  this parameter does nothing for other loci
# initial_homozyg_pos is the initial proportion that are homozygous positive at the locus
# initial_homozyg_neg is the initial proportion that are homozygous negative at the locus
